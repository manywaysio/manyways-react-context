Some buildings date back to the Middle Ages, and time seems to stand still along the cobblestone streets of its Old Town, dominated by the 12th-century St. Vincent Cathedral with its beautiful windows.</p>",

The name of its neighboring wine-producing region, Tain-l&rsquo;Hermitage, comes from the hermit who planted vines here after returning from the Crusades.
